      "description": "As the Marvel Age of Comics exploded on the pop-culture scene, super hero after super hero that redefined the genre leaped forth from the imagination of the Marvel Bullpen. Adventurers and innovators, scientists and high-school bookworms, they were amazing men and women with all the failings and foibles of you and me. And there are none that touch both that adventurer ideal and human reality as Tony Stark, the Invincible Iron Man. A jet-setter, playboy, and brilliant scientist, Tony is cut down to Earth when a battlefield explosion rips into his heart. Only by creating the amazing Iron Man armor can he stay alive!  Packed with the debonair and debutantes, Cold War monsters and sultry super-spies, the Iron Man Omnibus presents the stories of one of comics' most intriguing characters from the very beginning! Featuring the first appearances of such classic Marvel characters as the Mandarin, the Black Widow, Hawkeye, the Crimson Dynamo and the Titanium Man in lushly-illustrated stories by \"Dazzling\" Don Heck, Gene \"The Dean\" Colan and scripted by no less than Stan \"The Man\" Lee himself, this is the go-to volume for the Iron Man fan.  Including every page, every pinup, and every letters column. Not to mention unused covers, critical essays, and bonuses galore!  Collecting TALES OF SUSPENSE #39-83 & TALES TO ASTONISH #82.",

      "description": "A vain man driven by greed and hubris, Dr. Stephen Strange was a world-renowned surgeon until the night a car accident crippled his hands. Broken and destitute, he journeyed to Tibet to seek a cure from a legendary healer. He found not a man of medicine but the venerable Ancient One and the path to the mystic arts! Stan Lee and Steve Ditko reinvented the super hero with the Amazing Spider-Man, but from Dr. Strange's eerie house on a Greenwich Village corner they created new dimensions and otherworldly terrors. These stories remain as influential today as they were on 1960s' counter-culture. Marvel is proud to offer this Omnibus collection of the complete Lee/Ditko Doctor Strange run.

National Book Award winner and New York Times Best-Selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates (Between the World and Me) confronts T’Challa with dramatic upheaval in his homeland that will make leading the African nation tougher than ever before. When a superhuman terrorist group that calls itself The People sparks a violent uprising, the country famed for its incredible technology and proud warrior traditions will be thrown into turmoil! As Zenzi and Tetu, leaders of The People, poison the populace against its king, the spirit of T’Challa’s presumed-dead sister, Shuri, makes a transformative journey through Wakanda’s past, and a group of heroes, including Storm and Luke Cage, come together as The Crew to help Black Panther out. If Wakanda is to survive, it must adapt — but can its king, one of a long line of Black Panthers, survive the necessary change? Heavy is the head that wears the cowl!

A race of genetic freaks living secluded in their island kingdom of Attilan, their mutations are self-endowed; as a coming of age ritual, each Inhuman exposes himself to the Terrigen Mists, a strange substance that imparts unearthly powers - some extraordinary, some monstrous. But now Attilan is under attack from without and within. Can the Royal Family, led by the mute Black Bolt, repel the foreign invaders who assail their outer defenses, as well as the internal threat of Black Bolt's insane brother, Maximus the Mad? Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee infuse one of Marvel's oldest families with a modern sensibility - including international politics, class dissension and the age-old struggle of growing up.

      "description": "In 1962, in the pages of a comic book slated for cancellation, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko gave birth to one of the most-enduring icons in American popular media: the one and only Amazing Spider-Man! Turning the concept of a super hero on its head, they imbued the young, guilt-ridden Peter Parker with the fantastic powers of an arachnid and the fantastic pressures of an everyday teenager. The combination was pure magic. During the course of 40 issues of web-slinging, wisecracking wonderment Lee and Ditko built the foundation for 45 years of Spidey spectaculars - girl trouble; bill trouble; bully trouble; the Daily Bugle; and a cast friends, family and, of course, super-villains unlike any other! Completing the entire Stan Lee/Steve Ditko Spider-Man run in one massive volume -including every page, every pinup and every letters column. Not to mention unused covers, critical essays and bonuses galore! We went back to the Mighty Marvel Archive to restore each and every page in this volume for painstaking accuracy to the originals. There's no kidding - this collector's edition is the guaranteed be-all, end-all book for the Spider-Man fan!

It's an election year, and what better way to celebrate than to cast your vote for the one candidate who'll really tell it like it is. Born on a planet populated by talking waterfowl, Howard the Duck found himself trapped in a world he never made: ours! Howard was the archetypal outsider, able to see through the absurdities of human society in the 1970s with uncanny accuracy and an acerbic wit. His adventures presented writer Steve Gerber with a platform from which to engage in an ongoing critique of contemporary fools and pretenders, from power-mad capitalist wizard Pro-Rata to cult leader Reverend Joon Moon Yuc to the dreaded Doctor Bong! Experience for yourself the complete comic adventures of Howard in this Omnibus collection, reprinting his first appearances and the entire run of his first series. Collecting stories from ADVENTURE INTO FEAR #19, MAN-THING #1, GIANT-SIZE MAN-THING #4-5, HOWARD THE DUCK #1-33, MARVEL TREASURY EDITION #12 and MARVEL TEAM-UP #96.",
