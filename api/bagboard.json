Clint Barton, breakout star of a little Marvel movie you might have seen a while back, continues his fight for justice — and good rooftop BBQs! With Young Avenger Kate Bishop by his side, he’s out to get some downtime from being one of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes — but when the apartment building he’s moved into, and the neighbors he’s befriended, are threatened by a tracksuit-wearing, dog-abusing gang of Eastern European mobsters who say “bro” an awful lot, Clint must stand up and defend his new adopted family…any way he can. It’s Hawkguy, Kate, Pizza Dog et al. against the Clown, Madame Masque, the tracksuits and more in a fantastic, Eisner Award-nominated reinvention of the arrowed Avenger! Bro, you read this book. Okay, bro? Collecting HAWKEYE (2012) #1-22 and ANNUAL #1, and YOUNG AVENGERS PRESENTS #6.",

Broken and destitute, he journeyed to Tibet to seek a cure from a legendary healer. He found not a man of medicine but the venerable Ancient One and the path to the mystic arts! Stan Lee and Steve Ditko reinvented the super hero with the Amazing Spider-Man, but from Dr. Strange's eerie house on a Greenwich Village corner they created new dimensions and otherworldly terrors. These stories remain as influential today as they were on 1960s' counter-culture. Marvel is proud to offer this Omnibus collection of the complete Lee/Ditko Doctor Strange run.

National Book Award winner and New York Times Best-Selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates (Between the World and Me) confronts T’Challa with dramatic upheaval in his homeland that will make leading the African nation tougher than ever before. When a superhuman terrorist group that calls itself The People sparks a violent uprising, the country famed for its incredible technology and proud warrior traditions will be thrown into turmoil! As Zenzi and Tetu, leaders of The People, poison the populace against its king, the spirit of T’Challa’s presumed-dead sister, Shuri, makes a transformative journey through Wakanda’s past, and a group of heroes, including Storm and Luke Cage, come together as The Crew to help Black Panther out. If Wakanda is to survive, it must adapt — but can its king, one of a long line of Black Panthers, survive the necessary change? Heavy is the head that wears the cowl!

            "title": "Inhumans by Paul Jenkins & Jae Lee (Hardcover)",
            "description": "The Inhumans are one of Marvel's most enduring oddities. A race of genetic freaks living secluded in their island kingdom of Attilan, their mutations are self-endowed; as a coming of age ritual, each Inhuman exposes himself to the Terrigen Mists, a strange substance that imparts unearthly powers - some extraordinary, some monstrous. But now Attilan is under attack from without and within. Can the Royal Family, led by the mute Black Bolt, repel the foreign invaders who assail their outer defenses, as well as the internal threat of Black Bolt's insane brother, Maximus the Mad? Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee infuse one of Marvel's oldest families with a modern sensibility - including international politics, class dissension and the age-old struggle of growing up. Dark and grimly compelling, it remains one of Marvel Knights' most beloved stories. Collecting INHUMANS (1998) #1-12.",

            "description": "In 1962, in the pages of a comic book slated for cancellation, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko gave birth to one of the most-enduring icons in American popular media: the one and only Amazing Spider-Man! Turning the concept of a super hero on its head, they imbued the young, guilt-ridden Peter Parker with the fantastic powers of an arachnid and the fantastic pressures of an everyday teenager. The combination was pure magic. During the course of 40 issues of web-slinging, wisecracking wonderment Lee and Ditko built the foundation for 45 years of Spidey spectaculars - girl trouble; bill trouble; bully trouble; the Daily Bugle; and a cast friends, family and, of course, super-villains unlike any other! Completing the entire Stan Lee/Steve Ditko Spider-Man run in one massive volume -including every page, every pinup and every letters column. Not to mention unused covers, critical essays and bonuses galore! We went back to the Mighty Marvel Archive to restore each and every page in this volume for painstaking accuracy to the originals. There's no kidding - this collector's edition is the guaranteed be-all, end-all book for the Spider-Man fan! Collecting AMAZING FANTASY #15, AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #1-38 and ANNUAL #1-2, STRANGE TALES ANNUAL #2, and FANTASTIC FOUR ANNUAL #1.",
